    <h2>CS290, Assignment 0, 09/23/2016</h2>
    <li>My initial challenge was understanding the connection between this assignment and github. This was solved by a few ways.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>I continued to mess with Github and also search the website and internet for guidance. This involved going through a few tutorials a few times.</li>
            <li>I posted a question on Piazza about how to correctly perform steps three and four. I think my main issue was how the assignment sheet is worded. Steps three and four say to, "Add, commit, and push," and I took this as the order to perform these steps on Github.</li>
            <li>Lastly was by attending class to find out what information would be discussed about the assignment (in addition to attending class to learn course topics). After leaving class I had a lot more confidence on how to do the assignment.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Things I learned from the assignment:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Figure how what Github is and how to work with the website.</li>
            <li>Post questions on Piazza and attend class (as I always do).</li>
            <li>When I do not understand a tutorial, I need to watch it until I do.</li>
            <li>The some basics of writing HTML.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Things I already knew before the assignment:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>I had some fuzzy recollection on how to mess with our website on the ENGR server.</li>
            <li>Last winter I had a project where we had to create a website, and the member of the group that knew how to do it showed me how to initialize mine. By doing so I already knew the skeleton of a webpage.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Below are used helpful resources and how they were used:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Github - The provided tutorials on the assignment page, and then searching the website and internet for more elaboration.</li>
            <li>MDN - The HTML tutorial provided on the course website, and going to the "Getting Started with HTML" guide.</li>
            <li>Piazza - I posted a question and it was then answered. This answer was then supported by the professor.</li>
            <li>w3schools - I utilized this website in parallel with information on the MDN website to help comprehend more about the HTML language.</li>
        </ul>
