<ul>
    <li>My name is William Striby, but I prefer Keith.</li>
    <li>My major is Applied Computer Science specializing in GIScience, and this is my "second" year of studies.</li>
    <li>My confidence in web development is 0.5, because I was shown how to start our ENGR webpage.</li>
    <li>I hope to increase my web development skills exponentially and gain a lot of confidence.</li>
    <li>I have signed up for Piazza.</li>
    <li>My interesting fact is that I was an enlisted nuclear electricians mate on a nuclear powered submarine. After completing two years of training with the Naval Nuclear Power and Propulsion I then reported to the USS Tennessee (SSBN-734). While on board the Tennessee I earned the paygrade of First Class Petty Officer and achieved the qualification of Engineering Watch Supervisor and Engineering Duty Petty Officer.</li>
